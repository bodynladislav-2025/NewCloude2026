# Obsidian CLI

Use the `obsidian` CLI to interact with a running Obsidian instance. Requires Obsidian to be open.

## Command reference

Run `obsidian help` to see all available commands.

## Syntax

**Parameters** take a value with `=`. Quote values with spaces:

```bash
obsidian create name="My Note" content="Hello world"
```

**Flags** are boolean switches with no value:

```bash
obsidian create name="My Note" silent overwrite
```

For multiline content use `\n` for newline and `\t` for tab.

## File targeting

Many commands accept `file` or `path` to target a file. Without either, the active file is used.

- `file=<name>` — resolves like a wikilink (name only, no path or extension needed)
- `path=<path>` — exact path from vault root, e.g. `folder/note.md`

## Common patterns

```bash
obsidian read file="My Note"
obsidian create name="New Note" content="# Hello" template="Template" silent
obsidian append file="My Note" content="New line"
obsidian search query="search term" limit=10
obsidian daily:read
obsidian daily:append content="- [ ] New task"
obsidian property:set name="status" value="done" file="My Note"
obsidian tasks daily todo
obsidian tags sort=count counts
obsidian backlinks file="My Note"
```

Use `--copy` on any command to copy output to clipboard.
Use `silent` to prevent files from opening.
Use `total` on list commands to get a count.

## Check if CLI is available

```bash
if command -v obsidian &>/dev/null; then
    obsidian append file="Daily Note" content="New entry"
else
    # Fallback: write directly to vault file
    echo "content" >> /path/to/vault/note.md
fi
```
